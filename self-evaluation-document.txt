# ðŸ§¾ Self-Evaluation: Task Management Dashboard (React)

## a. Half-Page Summary

This project is a fully functional, client-side Kanban-style task management dashboard. It uses React for the UI and `json-server` to simulate backend operations such as task creation and updates. Tasks can be added via a modal form and dragged across columns (To Do, In Progress, Done). 

The drag-and-drop behavior is achieved using simple HTML5 events rather than external libraries, keeping the solution lightweight. Tailwind CSS ensures the UI is responsive and modern.

The project fulfills the core requirements â€” task CRUD, column view, and drag-and-drop interaction â€” in a clean and intuitive interface.

## b. Self-Criticism

- **No real authentication**: Any user can access and manipulate tasks without restriction.
- **No persistent state** beyond the mock API â€” refreshing after API failure could cause data loss.
- **Error handling is missing** for API calls (no try/catch or user alerts).
- **No loading or empty state UI** â€” the dashboard assumes everything loads smoothly.
- **Drag-and-drop UX could be enhanced** using libraries like `react-beautiful-dnd`.

## c. Improvements with More Time

- Add real authentication (e.g., Firebase Auth).
- Improve drag-and-drop with better feedback using `react-beautiful-dnd` or `dnd-kit`.
- Add loader, empty states, and better error handling.
- Use context or Redux for global state instead of local component state.
- Add task editing and deletion capabilities.
- Write unit and integration tests (e.g., with Jest + React Testing Library).
